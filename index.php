    <strong>The Stay Up Late Show</strong> &#40;SULS&#41; is a theatrical producing body focused on stimulating seasoned artists to make new work AND exposing new artists to established audiences. Formerly Seattle's longest running live talk show hosted by producer Rebecca M. Davis, SULS is sometimes a curated nerdlesque show too as well as a producer of fringe theatre productions. Based in Seattle, SULS went to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2016.
